      # --- Optional: Add a Recipe Model ---
      # If you were using a database:
      # 1. Generate a model: `rails generate model Recipe title:string ingredients:text instructions:text image_url:string`
      # 2. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
      # 3. Seed data: Add recipes in `db/seeds.rb` and run `rails db:seed`
      # 4. Update the controller: Replace mock data with `Recipe.all` or `Recipe.where(...)`
